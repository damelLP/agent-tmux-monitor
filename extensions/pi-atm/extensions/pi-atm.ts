/**
 * pi-atm — pi extension that forwards pi events to atmd for
 * monitoring in the ATM TUI.
 *
 * Symmetric counterpart to the bash `atm-hook` script that forwards
 * Claude Code hook events. This extension subscribes to the pi events
 * that drive vendor-neutral `LifecycleEvent` translation in
 * `atm-pi-adapter`, packages each event as `{event, payload, …}`, and
 * sends it to the atmd socket as `MessageType::PiEvent { data }`. The
 * daemon's connection layer parses the payload via `RawPiEvent::to_lifecycle_event()`
 * and applies the resulting LifecycleEvent to the session registry.
 *
 * Run:
 *   pi --extension /abs/path/to/pi-atm.ts
 *
 * Config (env):
 *   ATM_SOCKET   — daemon socket path (default: /tmp/atm.sock)
 *   ATM_DEBUG=1  — append debug log to /tmp/pi-atm.log
 *
 * NEVER throws or rejects — the contract is "if atmd is unavailable,
 * pi keeps working". All failures are swallowed (and optionally logged
 * when ATM_DEBUG=1).
 *
 * Tracks beads agent-tmux-manager-6dx.
