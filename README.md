Real-time management for coding agents across tmux sessions.

## What it does

ATM gives you a live dashboard and CLI for coding agents running in tmux, including Claude Code and pi. See context usage, cost, model, and activity at a glance — and control agents without switching panes.

- **Dashboard** — real-time TUI with session tree, context bars, cost tracking, and live terminal capture
- **Agent control** — spawn, kill, interrupt, send text, and reply to prompts from the CLI
- **Workspaces** — create tmux sessions with built-in ATM sidebars, or inject sidebars into existing sessions
- **Layouts** — preset multi-agent arrangements (solo, pair, squad, grid) with one command
- **Tmux native** — status bar integration, popup picker, vim-style keybindings

## Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damelLP/agent-tmux-manager/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Or via Cargo:

```bash
cargo install atm && atm setup
```

## Quick start

```bash
atm                    # launch TUI (starts daemon automatically)
```

Sessions appear as you use supported coding-agent harnesses. Press `Enter` to jump to any session, `q` to quit.

## CLI at a glance

```bash
atm spawn -m opus -d right         # spawn default harness with model and direction
atm spawn --harness pi             # spawn a specific harness
ATM_SPAWN_PI_BIN=mise ATM_SPAWN_PI_ARGS='x pi' atm spawn --harness pi
```

ATM auto-creates `~/.config/atm/config.toml` with defaults when spawn config is first loaded. Default spawn harness and per-harness spawn defaults can be configured there:

```toml
[harness]
default = "pi"

[harness.pi]
binary = "mise"
default_args = ["x", "pi"]
```

Environment overrides still take precedence when set (`ATM_SPAWN_PI_BIN/ARGS`, then legacy `ATM_SPAWN_BIN/ARGS`); otherwise config values are used, then built-in defaults.

```
atm kill <id>                      # kill agent and close pane
atm interrupt <id>                 # Ctrl+C an agent
atm send <id> "fix the tests"     # send text to agent
atm reply <id> --yes               # accept a permission prompt
atm peek <id> --prompt             # extract the active prompt
atm list -f json --status working  # list working agents as JSON
atm status                         # one-line summary for tmux status bar

atm workspace create               # new session with ATM sidebar + agent + shell
atm workspace attach               # inject sidebar into current session
atm layout pair                    # two agents + ATM sidebar
```

## How it works

```
Claude Code / pi  ──hook/extension──▶  atmd (daemon)  ◀──socket──  atm (TUI/CLI)
```

`atm setup` registers supported harness integrations (Claude Code hooks and the pi extension). Harness events are forwarded to the `atmd` daemon over a Unix socket, and `atm` connects for real-time display.
